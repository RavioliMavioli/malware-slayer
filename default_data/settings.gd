# this file is forced to be a .gd file because of how godot resources work
# normal text files are handled differently in editor run and in exported project
# having this file as a .cfg would work in editor runs, but break when exported
# fixing it requires changes to export settings, forcing .cfg files not to be exported
# which is a problem because 'export_presets' is in .gitignore
# meaning anyone cloning the repo would not be able to properly export
